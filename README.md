ScrollKeeper
============
ScrollKeeper is a cataloging system for documentation on open systems. It manages documentation metadata (as specified by the Open Source Metadata 
Framework(OMF)) and provides a simple API to allow help browsers to find, sort, and search the document catalog. It will also be able to communicate 
with catalog servers on the Net to search for documents which are not on the local system.
